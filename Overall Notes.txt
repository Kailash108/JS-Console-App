Steps to go ahead with Full Stack application(MERN)

1. nodejs -> For making able to run JS files on the computer
2. expressjs -> For creating the local testing server, creating routes, controllers and for connecting the backend and frontend.
3. mongoDB -> For making use of DB services
4. react -> completely for frontend

---------

As MERN is based upon MVC architecture, we need to have Models, Views, Controllers in our application

Models == Database Schema(using mongoose we can write schema for mongoDB)
Routers == These are the URL Patterns (/sigin, /signup, /admin, /homepage etc..,)
Controllers == What should be displayed to the user
----------

App.js is the main file for controlling all the backend. These mentioned things will be done using this file...
1. All the neccessary file/functionality imports
2. Connecting to the DB 
3. Middlewares
4. Routes
5. PORT
6. Starting the sever(npm start).

-----------

We only can add validation to a route using express-validator(check())...
Using router.POST(), we will be able to send the data to the server

Controllers can access the routes and the data which got using the API will be stored in the DB. 
It can be our choice to add validation to the route or not.
