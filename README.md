2. After that, open a terminal/command-line from the folder you have created and type 'npm install'. This will install all the packages and places them in a folder name 'node modules'.
3. Open the main file(jsConsoleProj.js) from a code editor and in its in-built terminal, type 'node jsConsoleProj.js'. This command will compile and execute the JS file.
